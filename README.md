# discourse-new-topic-tweetbot

Intended to run as a daemon on the host running Discourse, the bot
polls Discourse's latest topics (latest.json) then tweets new topics matching
your criteria to your registered Twitter feed.\*

Tweets may include a topic thumbnail image, if one exists, and Twitter hashtags
& mentions, if those exist. 
(see Twitter's automation rules at https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation#replies-mentions).

## Installation

The file `settings.ini`, or environment variables,  must be populated with
keys from both Discourse and Twitter. Instructions for creating Twitter keys
can be found at
https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/#creating-twitter-api-authentication-credentials.
Create a Discourse single-user key at â˜° > Settings > API > New API Key.

Valid setup & desired customizations can be tested before installation. 
At the command line, running `python3 discourse-new-topic-tweetbot.py` should
output the tweet-formatted text of the current most newly created topic, along
with the system path of its thumbnail image, if one exists.

The recommended installation method is `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
followed by `sudo install discourse_new_topic_tweetbot.py /usr/local/bin`. 
Of course running from a user's local python packages or venv works as well.
It is left to the user to manage running `discourse_new_topic_tweetbot.py`
as a daemon (e.g. using Docker, systemd, etc.)

If installed on a different host from the Discourse instance, the bot must be
customized to download topic thumbnail images, if those are desired.

To use the included Dockerfile, all required settings from `settings.ini` 
must be passed to `docker run` using environment variables, e.g. 
`sudo docker build . -t bot`
followed by
`sudo docker run -it --env-file settings.ini --entrypoint sh bot`
to test settings, and 
`sudo docker run -d --env-file settings.ini bot`
to run as a daemon. To access the Discourse server's images, add a bind mount,
e.g. 
`-v /var/discourse/shared/standalone:/var/discourse/shared/standalone`

## Settings & Customization

The file `settings.ini` contains authentication credentials and settings.

The default `POLLING_INTERVAL` is 10 minutes, and `TOPIC_REFRESH_INTERVAL`
interval is 8 minutes, allowing time for Discourse to generate thumbnails.

`TWEET_PREPEND` `TWEET_HASHTAGS` `TWEET_MENTIONS` will be added to the
beginning of each tweet, before the URL of the Discourse topic.

Inclusion of thumbnail media in tweets may be disabled by setting 
`TWEET_THUMBNAILS` to `None` or `0`.

Further customizations may be made in `discourse-new-topic-tweetbot.py`. Some
of the best candidates are the `build_tweet_string` function and the 
`HTMLMentionsParser` class.

\* At startup, the bot will poll & wait for new topics to appear in
`/latest.json` (that is, newer by creation date than the newest topic by
creation date found on the first polling), then tweet those newer topics.
If none among the topics appearing in `/latest.json` (a 30-item-long list)
on the first polling are actually NEW topics (just recently active topics),
the bot will tweet the NEWEST among them and continue on; technically this
is a design flaw, not a bug.
